# JavaHibernate
Simple CRUD Hibernate application using Java and Postgresql 

This program is a simple console based database application that manages a list of students record in PostgreSQL database. It has  CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) functionality to management the records and uses Java, Hibernate and PostgreSQL.


Hibernate is also an Object/Relational Mapping (ORM) framework which maps tables from database with Java objects, allows developers to build database relationship and access data easily through its mapping, configuration and APIs .


For this simple program, I used the following tools: (The older or newer version should also work).

1. Eclipse IDE for Java EE development

2. PostgreSQL server

3. PostgreSQL connector for Java

4. Hibernate ORM Jar files version 4.1.5.SP1
